                    <h2 class="abtus">ABOUT US</h2>
                    <p>Founded in 2002, through the merger of 3 reputable law firms, Unilegal LLC has since expanded rapidly in clientele and scope of work and has forged a network of sound working relationships with many law firms and professional firms around the globe.

                    Preserving the best interests of clients is our paramount concern. Our operating philosophy centres on being an "invaluable partner" of our clients. Constantly conscious of our role as an "invaluable partner", we relentlessly strive to improve our knowledge and expertise, move into uncharted waters and welcome challenges posed by our clients.

A further hallmark of our philosophy is the easy accessibility of our lawyers to clients. We provide prompt and sound advice, a high standard of work and we always go the extra mile for our clients. We measure our success by the success of our clients.</p>
